#Input/Output
[main.cpp lines 24-26](/main.cpp#L24)
I have demonstrated simple output and input by outputting a simple question targeted to the user. I also requested that they input their response demostrating my mastery of the subject.

##ControlFlow
[main.cpp lines 39-59](/main.cpp#L39)
In these lines i used an if statement to determined what route the user was to take. WHether they had an account or not. having two answers i used an if statement in order to determine if they needed to make an account or do regular ATM buisness. I then used an if else statement to determine what option they could pick from the ATM menu.
###Iteration
[main.cpp Lines 32-62](/main.cpp#L32)
in Lines 32 through 62 i used a do while statement in order to keep the ATM menu repeating until the user decided to exit the program.
[account.cpp Lines 119-125](/account.cpp#L119)
In these lines i used a for loop in order to keep track of how many names we have stored through the lifespan of the program
####Data Structures
[account.cpp Lines 121-123](/account.cpp#121)
in these three lines i used a vector in order to store the information of the customer. This shows my mastery of vectors as the name, pin number, and acount balnce were stored in different parts of the vector.
#####Functions
[account.cpp Lines 81-109](/account#81)
In my main cpp i used two types of functions including the int type in order to return the pin that they had created previously. I also used a float function in order to return the balance within the account. This function differs from the Int because a float uses a decimal point. In lines 102 i used a pass by value by using "coma" as a data type and setting the value as ",". instead of using the actual coma symbol. this shows my mastery because i was able to complete the program this way.
######File Input/Output Fstream
[account.cpp Lines 118-126](/account.cpp)
I showed mastery of Fstream in these lines by getting all my data from my class and saving it on too a new text file.
#######Classes
[account.h Lines 11-36](/account.cpp)
I showed mastery of this topic because i was succesfully able to create a class of users for the Atm. This class has three main points to it being the name,balance, and the pin number associated with each customer. I was also able to create functions that work in conjunction with my class file.
